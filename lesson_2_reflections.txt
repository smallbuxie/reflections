git status
git init (initialize current repository)
git commit -m "Commit message"

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git directory under current directory, though the files are not committed now.
I have to add them into tracked files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I dont quite understand what the staging area is, it seems like a buffer area preparing for the commit?
Or I should just always keep the ones I want to trace at the staging area.
