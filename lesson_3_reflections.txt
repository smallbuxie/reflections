git remote         (check remotes on computer)
git remote add origin URL
git remote -v (v for verbose: more info)
git push origin master (the first argument is the remote name, the second is the destination branch)
git pull origin master (similar lar)


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Of course it may be very useful if I have multiple work stations, or I am coorperating with others on some projects.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may want to get everything done before it is published (i.e. the public version should a executable version)
