git remote         (check remotes on computer)
git remote add origin URL
git remote -v (v for verbose: more info)
git push origin master (the first argument is the remote name, the second is the destination branch)
git pull origin master (similar lar)
git config --global credential.helper wincred (after running this, then login for once, it will store the credentials)
fork on github is like clone on github server
git clone URL

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Of course it may be very useful if I have multiple work stations, or I am coorperating with others on some projects.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may want to get everything done before it is published (i.e. the public version should a executable version)


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks work for copying others' project on GitHub to your own GitHub account.
Clones is for getting a repository from GitHub to local computer.
Branch is to creat a new 'version' of the current project in your local computer.
Of course, they should be used as described here.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that when pull things from GitHub, it knows how to deal with the conflict.
